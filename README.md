# Why did I start to learn Java?
I decided to learn a new programming language.
I was previously programming in Swift and C#, but as I lost access to the MacOS and I wasn't enjoying C#, thus I quit both for now. (Swift, one day I'll come back to you!)

So why not Java? I googled the best programming language course available and found great references about the MOOC provided by the University of Helsinki. As it was free, I didn't think much about it and decided to give it a try. 
A lot of friends already knew Java, so I wanted to fit into the group xD.

Here we have all the exercises that I've done from the "Object Oriented Programming with Java" MOOC made by the University of Helsinki. 

The course explains the concepts very clearly. I can see some progress at this first stage. Looking forward to complete parts 1 & 2!
