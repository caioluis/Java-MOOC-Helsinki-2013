# Why did I start to learn Java?
I decided to learn a new programming language.
I was previously programming in Swift and C#, but as I lost access to the MacOS and I wasn't enjoying C#, thus I quit both for now. (Swift, one day I'll come back to you!)

So why not Java? I googled the best programming language course available and found great references about the MOOC provided by the University of Helsinki. As it was free, I didn't think much about it and decided to give it a try. 

On this repo we have all the exercises that I've done from the "Object Oriented Programming with Java" MOOC made by the University of Helsinki. 

The course explains the concepts very clearly. I can see some progress at this first stage. Looking forward to complete part 2!

# My thoughts on the course
On 19th December, I completed the first part of the MOOC. At first, it covered logic basics that I was familiar with, as I had previously studied programming logic years ago. Afterwards, the MOOc proceeds to introduce more complex concepts. The course is certainly solid and simple to understand. Although some exercises seem tricky to solve, it teaches the concepts in a well-structured manner and I was able to grasp that information after all.

Here's my certificate for part 1.

I'll keep this updated when I complety part 2 (and start the 2020 finnish version).
